# # 1.   Working With Numbers
# # 2.   Getting Input From Users


# # 1.   Building a Basic Calculator
# # 2.   Mad Libs Game




































# # Review
# create variables for the following :
# 1. age
age = 15 #integer variable
# 2. name
name = "Ulysses" #string variable
# 3. song
song = "She" #string variable
# 4. food
food = "steak" #string variable
# 5. number
number = 4 #integer variable


# #now include the variables you just made print in the following...

#put the age and number in a new sentence
date_of_birth = 2021
number2 = 123
number3 = 123.456
number4 = 123.33
number5 = 4555
#create a sentence of all of this above

print("His date of birth was " + str(date_of_birth) + " and he loved three specific numbers which are " + str(number2) + ", " + str(number3) + ", and " + str(number4) + ".")

print(f"the date of birth is {date_of_birth} and the number is {number2} and the number is {number3} and the number is {number4} and the number is {number5}")



# Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name].
print(f"Once upon a time, there was a {age} year old coder named {name}.")

# [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.

print(f"{name} liked to hum the song, {song} while coding. It was so annoying that their teamates would throw {food} until {name} would stop singing.")

# Still, [name] was the best coder on the team and could write [number] lines of code every day. Maybe [song] was [name]â€™s secret power?
print("Still, " + name + " was the best coder on the team and could write " + str(number) + " lines of code every day. Maybe " + song + " was " + name + "'s" + " secret power?")

# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh),
#    or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
# 6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"


# Here are some exercises to practice the rules:


# Correcting Invalid Names: Below are some invalid names. Correct them according to the rules:


# first_name
# last_name
# email_address
# percent
# variable_name
# zero
# list # this is a keyword in python
#you cannot use it for your own variable name
# Creating Valid Names: Create valid names for the following descriptions:


# The first name of a person
# The last name of a person
# The email address of a person
# The percentage of marks obtained by a student
# A variable to store the number of items in a shopping cart




# Identify Valid and Invalid Names: Identify which of the following names are valid or invalid according to the rules:


# first_name
# lastName
# email_address
# percentage
# variable_name
# 1_variable , Correct: variable
# email@address , Correct: email_address
# percentage% , Correct: percentage
# i , Correct: ink

# # **Working with** **numbers** **bold text**
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division


# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals).
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers.
# Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python.

# #addition
print(2+1)
# #multiplication
print(2*2)
# #division
print(6/2)
# #modulo
print(7%4) #remainder of 7 divided by 4
# #powers
print(2**3) #2 to the power of 3
# #get the max and min of a number
print("the max of 2 and 3 is", max(2,3))
#max means the largest number
print("the min of 2 and 3 is", min(2,3))
#min means the lowest number


# #round a number
print("round 3.9 is", round(3.9))
# # absolute value
print("the absolute value of -3 is", abs(-3))
#absolute value means the distance from 0
# it will always be positive


# # order of operations
# #to do more you need to import special math libraries from python
from math import *    
# #this goes out and grabs some different math functions we can use
# #floor method
print("the floor of 3.7 is",floor(3.7))
print("the floor of 128.8 is",floor(128.8))
#floor means round down
# #ceil method
print("the ceil of 3.7 is",ceil(3.7))
print("the ceil of 128.8 is",ceil(128.8))
#ceil means round up
# #sqrt method

# So what have we learned? We learned some of the basics of numbers in Python. We also learned how to do arithmetic and use Python as a basic calculator. We then wrapped it up with learning about Variable Assignment in Python.
# # **Getting Input from users**
# #how do we get input from users?
# input("what is your name?")
name = input("What is your name?")
# # basic math calculator
# #ask the user for 2 numbers
num1 = int(input("Enter a number:"))
num2 = int(input("Enter another number:"))
# # print out a statement where you:
# # add them together
print(num1 + num2)
# #multiply
print(num1 * num2)
# # find the max number
print(max(num1, num2))
# # find the remainder of the numbers
print(num1 % num2)
# #round one number
print(round(num1))

numb1 = int(input("Enter your first number:"))
numb2 = int(input("Enter your second number:"))
print("The total when subtracting your two numbers is",(numb1 - numb2))
print("The total when dividing your two numbers is",(numb1 / numb2))
print("THe min of your numbers is",min(numb1,numb2))
print("The absolute value of your first number is",abs(numb1))
print("The floor of your first number is",floor(numb1))
print("The ceiling of your second number is",ceil(numb2))
print("The square root of your first number is",sqrt(numb1))
